          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            DoDo Dynamics, a team of five students from three different
            countries, is on a mission to reinvent recreational boating. Their
            goal for this project revolves around enabling a canoe to achieve
            sustained flight approximately 2 ft above the water's surface, with
            a maximum load capacity of 600 lbs. The team aims to accomplish this
            by retrofitting hydrofoils and implementing an electric powertrain
            into an existing canoe. The objective is to mitigate air and noise
            pollution typically associated with boating on lakes, while
            simultaneously injecting a thrilling and exhilarating experience.

        <div class="project">
          <h3>Project</h3>
          <p>
            In traditional water sports, there exists a dichotomy between two
            distinct experiences. On one end, lake boating and jet skiing are
            intensive and can be disruptive to the environment. On the other
            end, canoeing provides a serene and tranquil experience, albeit at a
            slower pace. Recognizing the potential in merging the advantages of
            both worlds, DoDo Dynamics is presently engaged in the design and
            construction of an Electric Hydrofoil Canoe. The primary objective
            of this endeavor is to create a vessel that embodies the best of
            both realms: speed and excitement, coupled with a quiet and
            affordable nature. The core aim is to achieve a state of stable and
            level flight, accomplished by lifting the canoe hull above the
            water's surface at a takeoff speed of four meters per second. To
            accomplish this, the canoe will be equipped with twin electric
            motors and marine batteries, which will serve as the power source
            for the innovative hydrofoil system.

            <p>
              Originally from the prairies of Red Deer Alberta, Dermot
              MacDougall possesses an unwavering passion for marine vessels and
              maritime engineering. In addition, Dermot's fascination with
              aircraft and aerodynamic design, alongside his dedication to such
              a project, instills him with confidence in both himself and his
              team's ability to bring the hydrofoil canoe to fruition.

            <p>
              Trevor has a heart torn between cars and bicycles, which is why it
              was only fair that he do a capstone taking the form of a boat.
              With an academic background in statistics and business admin, plus
              a vocational background in manufacturing and residential
              construction, Trevor's combination of analytical and physical
              skills will provide a strong support for all members of the team.

            <p>
              Griffin was always interested in math and sciences, leading him to
              take things apart to understand them better (and rarely reassemble
              them). His keen eye for detail and broad understanding of a
              variety of manufacturing techniques allows him to contribute to
              many different aspects of the project. He's interested in
              motorsports, specifically cars, and the variety of things which
              mechanical engineering covers grabbed his interest and has held it
              for years. He intends to take the engineering bridge to UVIc and
              go on to get a full degree.

              Fatima has always been curious about how machines work, which has
              led her to pursue a career in mechanical engineering. Also, she
              has always been drawn to courses that offer hands-on technical
              experience. Fatima is interested in assembling, building, and
              marine engineering. Through the Flying Canoe project, she has
              gained technical experiences in designing, building and testing.
              She aspires to join the Bridge program at Uvic to get her
              Bachelor's degree.

              Victoria has always had a deep fascination with aircraft. As a
              child she always loved going on planes, and was always curious on
              how they were designed and built. Mechanical Engineering is a
              pathway to a career in aerospace engineering. Victoria is hoping
              to further her studies in the UVIC aerospace program. She is
              confident that this project will challenge her to develop the
              skills necessary to pursue her goals.
