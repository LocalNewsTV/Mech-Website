          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Fork to Ball Design (FTB) is a group that designs and manufactures
            trailers capable of lifting pallets. We design our products from
            fork to ball. Holocene distillery is a company owned and operated by
            Dorian Redden. His distillery makes gin and absinthe using locally
            sourced ingredients. Holocene distillery relies on heavy loads of
            grain to be delivered to its facility to manufacture its products.

          <h3>Project</h3>
          <p>
            FTB Design is manufacturing a solution for Holocene distillery to
            safely transport loads of grain up a hill to their facility. We are
            proposing a pallet jack trailer, which can be towed behind a
            vehicle, to solve this problem.
