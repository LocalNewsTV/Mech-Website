          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Dionysus systems is excited to be designing and manufacturing a mash
            press for Holocene Distilling Project. Our product will assist our
            client, Dorian Redden, in achieving his goal of carbon neutrality by
            allowing him to recover otherwise lost or wasted energy stored in
            the mash as fuel for his boiler.

        <div class="project">
          <h3>Project</h3>
          <p>
            The primary waste product from distilling operations is called mash,
            an organic matter from which starches and sugars have been removed.
            Mash has a high-moisture content, which must be removed quickly
            after distilling to prevent spoilage. Our team will design an
            apparatus that can remove large amounts of water from the mash to
            increase storage time until it can be further processed into
            pellets.
