        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The Konditioner Kings have partnered with the founder of Green Room, Danielle Lapointe,
          to create a multipurpose conditioner-bar cutter. The mechanism will be used, exclusively, by
          the Green Room company who specializes in vegan, plastic-free, biodegradable shampoo and
          conditioner bars.

        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>
          For this project, we are designing a multipurpose cutter that is able to cut off the meniscus as
          well as cut bars to a desired size. The meniscus is an undesirable, U-shaped feature, that
          develops on the top of a liquid when the containerâ€™s material attracts the molecules of the
          liquid. Our design will be provided in a compact, lightweight, and efficient manner while
          remaining cost-effective.

            Matthew has always been fascinated by the intricacies of how things work. This interest has
            driven him to pursue a career in mechanical engineering. He possesses strong
            critical-thinking and problem-solving abilities which are enhanced by his broad knowledge
            of engineering principles. Matthew has experience in industry after completing a co-op work
            term with Babcock Canada, where he was responsible for tracking and managing the
            development of hundreds of classified documents and occasionally carrying out tests on the
            many systems of the Victoria-Class submarines.

          <p>
            Keagan spent a lot of his childhood tinkering with and repairing bikes while competing in
            triathlons. This experience developed an interest in how other mechanisms function and how
            much thought goes into every detail of a design. Having done woodwork throughout
            highschool, as well as the two years of metalwork at Camosun, he is very comfortable with
            machining equipment. Keagan also has a strong understanding of coding with C++ through
            the use of Arduino Uno. He hopes to build upon his critical-thinking and decision-making
            skills during this project.

            Lucas has a Chemical and Environmental Technology diploma with a focus in process
            engineering from BCIT and has a real interest in the process industries. Over the past two
            years in the Mechanical Engineering Technology program, Lucas has gained an interest in
            design. Lucas's summer Co-op with West Fraser has given him skills in project management
            and project development while allowing him to take part in major maintenance projects.
            Lucas looks forward to working with the group to develop a well-designed project.

            Nate has been interested in mechanics and electronics since a young age. After graduating
            highschool, keen on following his passion, he began studying at Camosun College. After 2
            years at Camosun, he has become well-versed in design, CAD & CAM, manufacturing,
            programming, C++ & ladder logic, FEA, as well as general knowledge about the mechanical
            engineering field. Although he primarily focuses on manufacturing and design, he is flexible
            and adept at learning new things.

          We would like to thank the Camosun faculty who mentored us and helped us supportively
          throughout his entire process. We would also like to thank our sponsor, Danielle Lapointe,
          without whom this project would not be possible. We are very appreciative of the
          opportunity to gain knowledge from this project that can be used in our future professional
          careers.
