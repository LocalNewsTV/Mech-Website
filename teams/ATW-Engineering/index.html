        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Fossil Beach Farm offers accommodation, local food and a farm crafted cidery. Currently, the bottling process
          for the cider is small scale and inefficient. For the Fossil Beach Farm bottle filler project, ATW Engineering
          is offering an innovative machine solution that will increase production and produce a shelf-stable product
          for consumer purchase that utilizes counterpressure bottle filling methods.
        </p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>
          Jeff Zamluk, owner of Fossil Beach Farm, has been experiencing a higher demand during the summer season for
          his farm-brewed, craft-cider product. His current production process is time consuming, and the product is not
          shelf stable. Jeff reached out to Camosun College in hopes of solving his inefficient production process and
          shelf-stable cider predicaments, with capstone 2023. If these predicaments can not be contained, Fossil Beach
          Farm will continue devoting unnecessary time and money towards their bottled cider product.
        </p>
        <p>
          ATW Engineering was intrigued and devoted to solving these problems for Jeff and Fossil Beach Farm the moment
          the project was presented to them. ATW Engineering will produce a four-station, automatic, and innovative,
          counter pressure bottle filling machine.

          This machine will automatically fill cider bottles faster than current production methods at Fossil Beach
          Farm, as well as save labour costs. This machine will also automatically purge the cider bottles of oxygen,
          and replace this oxygen with CO2, to ensure a shelf-stable product.
        </p>
        <p>
          This machine will fully address the time and cost consumption worries associated with the manual cider
          bottling process at Fossil Beach Farm, allowing Jeff to focus on more necessary portions of his company.
