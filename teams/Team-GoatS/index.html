          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Team Goat.S is proud to be fulfilling a research project for Camosun College to improve the lives of manual wheelchair users. Our goal is to produce a safe, innovative, portable system that enables manual wheelchair users to navigate residential stairs with ease. This project is made possible with the help of our advisors, Jeffrey Stephen and Richard Burman.

          <h3>Project</h3>
          <p>
            With many homes having stairs at their entrances, manual wheelchair users have great difficulty visiting family and friends. To navigate this issue, they are often limited in venues they can visit, or need physical help from others. This is an obstacle in wheelchair users' daily lives, forcing them to make additional arrangements or purchase difficult to transport equipment.

            As such, our goal is to research, design and manufacture a system that provides manual wheelchair users with improved accessibility to many places that were previously inaccessible to them because of stairs. The delivered system will be safe, portable, and easy to use.

              Rob has four decades of success in IT problem solving across North America at the headquarters of AT&T, Ford, Nissan, and other multinationals as a consultant, as well as for crown corporations, and state and provincial governments. Enjoying lifelong STEM learning, wide reading, pole walking, and the quiet outdoors are Rob's interests. Rob plans to pursue a Master of Industrial Ecology degree. He is an expert in logical analysis, problem visualization and troubleshooting. This capstone project brings that background to Mechanical Engineering. Rob makes novel solutions realistic options by defining, measuring, and testing new concepts. “Impossible!” becomes, “Why was it ever even an obstacle?”
