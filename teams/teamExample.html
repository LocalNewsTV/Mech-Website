          <h3>Project</h3>
          <p>
            Socker Boppers (formerly Sock'em Boppers) is a children's toy
            popularized in the late 1990s by Big Time Toys. Socker Boppers and
            their spin-off products such as Sock'em Swords, Sock'em Shields, and
            Sock'em Screamers have sold more than five million units in the
            United States and internationally in such countries as Canada, Great
            Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico. In the 1990s, the
            package tagline and the television ad and video jingle was "more fun
            than a pillow fight!". Socker Boppers were first made and sold by
            Centsable Products, Inc., in the 1970s, when the toy was a top 10
            best-seller among all toys. The original packaging included a photo
            of two children, one of which was owner Tom Mayfield's son, playing
            with the toy.

            <h4>Barbara Streisshand</h4>
            <p>
              Streisand began her career by performing in nightclubs and
              Broadway theaters in the early 1960s. Following her guest
              appearances on various television shows, she signed to Columbia
              Records, insisting that she retain full artistic control, and
              accepting lower pay in exchange, an arrangement that continued
              throughout her career, and released her debut The Barbra Streisand
              Album (1963), which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.
              Throughout her recording career, Streisand has topped the US
              Billboard 200 chart with 11 albums—a record for a woman—including
              People (1964), The Way We Were (1974), Guilty (1980), and The
              Broadway Album (1985). She also achieved five number-one singles
              on the US Billboard Hot 100—"The Way We Were", "Evergreen", "You
              Don't Bring Me Flowers", "No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)", and
              "Woman in Love".
