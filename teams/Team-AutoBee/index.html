        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Team Autobee's project is to make a beeswax food wrap cutting
          machine for Abeego. Abeego is a local company that mainly produces
          reusable food wrap with 100% zero waste. The company highly focuses
          on sustainability and is certified as a B corporation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>
          At the end of April, our team met with Toni Desrosiers, the founder
          of Abeego. Toni sought a machine to reduce manual labor and work
          strain in her production facility. Our team was immediately excited
          by the potential of the project and the vision expressed by Toni.
          Our machine removes the manual cutting process by automating the
          trimming and cutting process of the food wrap.
        </p>
        <p>
          The machine utilizes commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components and
          in-house design parts. Our team places ease of use, longevity, and
          manufacturability as the top design priorities. The machinery
          consists of a feed system, trim system, length-cutting system,
          end-product collection system, and control system. All systems are
          integrated to create a functional machine.

            Kenneth moved to Victoria, Canada in 2017 and continued his studies in Mechanical Engineering
            Technology at Camosun College. He has always had an interest in how things work mechanically, and he
            also enjoys working with his hands, which is why he played a role in developing and fabricating
            prototypes for the project. Through this program, Kenneth has developed and expanded his skills and
            knowledge in the industry to apply them in real life. In his free time, Kenneth spends most of his time
            with family and friends.
